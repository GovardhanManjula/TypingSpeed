Implement a typing speed test that presents the user with a set of sentences or paragraphs to type accurately and quickly. Measure the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM) or characters per minute (CPM).
Include a feature to evaluate the user's typing accuracy. This can involve counting errors, mistyped words, or incorrect characters.
Create visualizations, such as charts or graphs, to illustrate the user's progress over time. This can motivate users to continue practicing
If the goal is to improve typing skills, include training modules or exercises. These could focus on specific keys, finger placements, or typing techniques.
Provide detailed performance metrics after each test, highlighting areas of improvement and offering suggestions for enhancing typing skills.
